# Data-Exploration Project
Repo containing the code for exploring a dataset as part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree

## Overview

This Project is submitted as part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.

For it the goal is to prepare a Jupyter Notebook to explore a reference data set, in order to use the results as a support for the content of a Medium blog.

---
### Requirements

In order to facilitate the execution of the Notebook I have prepared an [`environment.yml`](./environment.yml) file to be used to install an environment with [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads):

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

After the installation the environment should be visible via `conda info --envs`:

```sh
# conda environments:
#
dsnd-proj1        /usr/local/anaconda3/envs/dsnd-proj1
...

```
